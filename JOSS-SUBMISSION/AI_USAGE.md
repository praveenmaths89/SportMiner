# AI Usage Disclosure

## Summary

AI-assisted tools were used during the development of the SportMiner package. This document provides full disclosure of AI usage in accordance with JOSS submission requirements.

## Tools Used

- Large Language Models (LLMs) such as Claude and GPT-4 were used to assist with:
  - Documentation generation and refinement
  - Unit test scaffolding
  - Code comment generation
  - Error message standardization

## Scope of AI Usage

AI tools were NOT used for:
- Core algorithmic design
- Workflow architecture decisions
- Statistical methodology implementation
- API integration logic

AI tools WERE used for:
- Generating initial drafts of documentation
- Suggesting test case structures
- Improving code readability through comments
- Refining error messages for user clarity

## Human Oversight

All AI-generated content was:
- Carefully reviewed by the authors
- Validated for correctness and accuracy
- Modified as needed to ensure quality
- Tested to verify functional correctness

The authors take full responsibility for all code, documentation, and content in the package, regardless of the tools used during development.

## Core Contribution

The core intellectual contribution of SportMiner (workflow design, implementation strategy, integration patterns, and domain abstraction) represents original work by the authors. AI tools served as productivity aids, not as substitutes for domain expertise or software engineering judgment.

## Compliance

This disclosure is provided in accordance with JOSS editorial policies on the use of AI-assisted tools in software development and manuscript preparation.
